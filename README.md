# PixelMelt

![PixelMelt demo](./docs/pixelmelt-demo.png)

PixelMelt is a desktop-first, local-only web app that turns a single image into a live falling-material simulation. Upload an image, convert it into a low-resolution material field, then melt it, flood it, burn it, poke it, and export an 8-second WebM clip without leaving the browser.

The entire product runs client-side. There is no backend, no auth, no database, and no paid API dependency.

## Highlights

- Upload one image and convert it into a 168x168 material map.
- Run the simulation in a Web Worker and render it with crisp nearest-neighbor upscaling on HTML5 Canvas.
- Switch between three scene presets: `Melt`, `Flood`, and `Burn`.
- Interact directly with the simulation using `Push`, `Spark`, and `Erase`.
- Export an 8-second WebM clip from the live canvas.
- Start instantly with three seeded demo images included in the repo.
- Deploy the build output as a static site.

## Stack

- Vite
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Zustand
- HTML5 Canvas
- Web Worker
- Vitest
- Playwright (local browser validation)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local Vite URL printed in the terminal.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run check
```

## Demo Flow

1. Launch the app. `Molten Echo` loads automatically.
2. Click `Melt`, `Flood`, or `Burn` to rebuild the scene from the same source image.
3. Drag on the stage with `Push` to shove loose material around.
4. Switch to `Spark` and click into the scene to create ember bursts and smoke.
5. Switch to `Erase` to carve vents or remove buildup.
6. Upload your own image with the drop zone or file picker.
7. Click `Record 8s clip` to export a WebM of the live simulation.

## How It Works

### 1. Image Conversion

The uploaded image is rasterized into a square 168x168 working grid. A conversion pass samples luminance, saturation, alpha, and background similarity to classify each cell as one of:

- `sand`
- `water`
- `stone`
- `ember`
- `smoke`
- `empty`

The conversion output becomes the base scene for all presets.

### 2. Preset Rebuilds

Each preset is a deterministic transform on top of the base material map:

- `Melt` weakens exposed stone into sand and seeds hot drips near the lower silhouette.
- `Flood` pushes water across the top edge and left side of the scene.
- `Burn` ignites exposed surfaces and seeds smoke above hot cells.

Because presets rebuild from the base snapshot, users can switch modes without re-uploading the image.

### 3. Simulation Loop

The simulation runs inside [`src/workers/simulation.worker.ts`](./src/workers/simulation.worker.ts). The worker advances the grid at 60 FPS and posts frames back to the main thread at 30 FPS.

The core update rules live in pure modules under [`src/sim`](./src/sim):

- [`src/sim/simulation.ts`](./src/sim/simulation.ts): particle stepping rules
- [`src/sim/tools.ts`](./src/sim/tools.ts): push, spark, erase brushes
- [`src/sim/presets.ts`](./src/sim/presets.ts): preset transforms
- [`src/sim/image-to-material.ts`](./src/sim/image-to-material.ts): source image conversion

The canvas renderer in [`src/components/CanvasStage.tsx`](./src/components/CanvasStage.tsx) draws the low-resolution frame buffer into a larger display canvas with image smoothing disabled, keeping the pixel edges sharp.

### 4. Clip Export

PixelMelt records directly from the display canvas using `canvas.captureStream()` and `MediaRecorder`. Export is intentionally fixed to 8 seconds so the output is lightweight and easy to share.

src/components/               React UI and canvas stage
src/lib/                      Worker bridge, rasterizer, recorder, helpers
src/sim/                      Pure simulation, conversion, presets, and tests

```

## Validation

The current repo has been validated with:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- local browser automation covering preset changes, tool interactions, upload, and WebM export

## Static Deployment

PixelMelt builds to plain static assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the resulting `dist/` directory to any static host. No environment variables are required.

## Browser Notes

- WebM recording works best in current Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.
- The app is intentionally desktop-first. It will render on smaller screens, but the interaction model is tuned for mouse and trackpad use.
